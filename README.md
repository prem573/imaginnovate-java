# Imaginnovate Java Training Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises, assignments, and sample projects organized by training weeks. It covers fundamental Java concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling, networking basics, and SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **training/sample-echo/**: Sample project demonstrating basic OOP concepts with Employee and Department classes.
- **training/week2/**: Basic Java programs including loops, arrays, strings, inheritance, and algorithms (e.g., prime numbers, GCD, palindromes).
  - **Basics/**: Fundamental programs like Hello World, countdowns.
  - **library/1/**: Advanced string methods, date handling, object cloning.
  - **oops1/**: Object-oriented programming exercises.
- **training/week3/**: Intermediate topics including generics, networking (Client/Server), and assignment questions.
  - **AssignmentQuestions/**: Practical assignments on interfaces, collections, lambdas, exception handling, and file I/O.
- **training/sql/**: SQL query exercises for database operations.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- A Java IDE like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse (recommended for running and debugging).

## How to Compile and Run

1. Navigate to the desired Java file or project directory.
2. Compile the Java file(s):
   ```
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```
   java ClassName
   ```

For projects with multiple files (e.g., sample-echo), compile all files together:

```
javac *.java
java Main
```

For programs requiring command-line arguments (e.g., Prime.java), run with:

```
java Prime 17
```

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Arrays and collections
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Exception handling
- File I/O operations
- Generics and lambda expressions
- Basic networking with sockets
- SQL queries for data manipulation
